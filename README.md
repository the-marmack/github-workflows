# github-workflows

> Forked from [`bitwise-media-group/github-workflows`](https://github.com/bitwise-media-group/github-workflows) (MIT).

Reusable [GitHub Actions workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows) for Bitwise
Media Group repositories. Each consuming repo keeps a thin **caller** workflow that owns its triggers and calls one of
these by `uses:`, so CI, CodeQL, release, and the fast-forward `/merge` flow live in one place instead of being
copy-pasted per repo.

Copy a caller from [`examples/`](examples/) into your repo's `.github/workflows/`, then pin it (see
[Pinning](#pinning)).

## Catalog

All reusable workflows live in [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/) and are `workflow_call`-only. Every external
action is pinned to a full commit SHA; the org Renovate bot
([`the-marmack/renovate-config`](https://github.com/the-marmack/renovate-config)) keeps the pins fresh.

Each workflow below lists its inputs, secrets, and the permission ceiling the **caller** must grant — a reusable
workflow's jobs cannot exceed the permissions of the job that calls them. The snippet is the minimal caller; follow the
link beneath it for the fully-commented version.

### `ci.yaml`

_Any repo._ Runs the canonical mise tasks — `lint`, `build`, `test` — as one parallel job each, with every toolchain
(Go, Node, Python, uv) and dev CLI installed from the repo's mise pins, and uploads coverage to Codecov from a job
isolated from PR-built code. Tasks the repo does not define are skipped; a repo with no mise config at all fails. A repo
that commits its build output has its `dist/` verified up to date after `mise run build` (so a stale committed artifact
fails the PR). An opt-in `e2e` job runs `mise run e2e`. A caller may add product-specific jobs (e.g. `integration`)
alongside the `ci` job.

- **Inputs:** `e2e` (default `false`), `coverage` (default `true`; set `false` for repos that emit no coverage or test
  results).
- **Secrets:** none.
- **Permissions (caller grants):** `contents: read`.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main", "releases/*"]
permissions:
  contents: read
jobs:
  ci:
    uses: the-marmack/github-workflows/.github/workflows/ci.yaml@v2
```

Full example: [`examples/ci.yaml`](examples/ci.yaml).

### `security.yaml`

_Any repo._ CodeQL analysis whose language matrix is detected at the repo root: `actions` (build-free) always, plus `go`
(via `autobuild`, compiling with the Go toolchain from the repo's mise pins) when a root `go.mod` exists and
`javascript-typescript` (build-free) when `package.json` exists.

- **Inputs:** `config-file` (optional, default none; pass `./.github/codeql/codeql-config.yaml`, copy
  [`examples/codeql-config.yaml`](examples/codeql-config.yaml), to exclude a bundled `dist/`).
- **Secrets:** none.
- **Permissions (caller grants):** `security-events: write`, `packages: read`, `actions: read`, `contents: read`.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main", "releases/*"]
  schedule:
    - cron: "28 20 * * 4"
permissions:
  security-events: write
  packages: read
  actions: read
  contents: read
jobs:
  analyze:
    uses: the-marmack/github-workflows/.github/workflows/security.yaml@v2
```

Full example: [`examples/security.yaml`](examples/security.yaml).

### `release.yaml`

_Any repo._ Runs release-please (two-pass), then branches by detection: a repo with a `.goreleaser.yaml` runs GoReleaser
(archives, checksums, SBOMs, cosign signatures, Developer ID-signed and notarized macOS binaries, optional Homebrew
cask, SLSA attestation) — Go, goreleaser, cosign and syft all come from the repo's mise pins, so the release is built by
the same versions as `mise run release` locally; every other repo's release is just the release-please cut. A repo with
a `zensical.toml` also rebuilds its Zensical docs site (`uv run zensical build`) and publishes it to GitHub Pages —
gated on an actual release and keyed off config presence exactly like the GoReleaser path, so it is independent of
GoReleaser (a repo can ship binaries and docs from one release). With `vanity-tags: true` it also moves the floating
major and minor tags (`v1` and `v1.1`). A committed `dist/` is verified for freshness in [`ci.yaml`](#ciyaml) on every
PR, not at release time.

- **Inputs:** `vanity-tags` (default `false`; move the floating `v1` / `v1.1` tags — set it for Actions/reusable repos
  whose consumers pin `@v1`), `app-client-id` (optional; author the release as a GitHub App rather than `GITHUB_TOKEN` —
  `vars.FF_MERGE_CLIENT_ID`).
- **Secrets:** `homebrew-tap-token` — optional; only needed if `.goreleaser.yaml` publishes a Homebrew cask to another
  repo (`secrets.HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN`). `app-private-key` — optional; required only when `app-client-id` is set
  (`secrets.FF_MERGE_PRIVATE_KEY`). `macos-sign-p12`, `macos-sign-password`, `macos-notary-issuer-id`,
  `macos-notary-key-id`, `macos-notary-key` — optional; only read by a `.goreleaser.yaml` with a `notarize.macos` block
  (`secrets.MACOS_SIGN_P12` / `MACOS_SIGN_PASSWORD` / `MACOS_NOTARY_ISSUER_ID` / `MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_ID` /
  `MACOS_NOTARY_KEY`). All five are org secrets scoped to the notarizing repos — the shared open-source Developer ID
  certificate and the team notary key — see [macOS notarization: org setup](#macos-notarization-org-setup).
- **Auto-merging release PRs:** set `app-client-id` + `app-private-key` (reuse the "FF Merge" App) so release-please
  authors the release PR as the App. A release PR whose branch is pushed by the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` does **not** emit
  `workflow_run` events — GitHub's recursion guard suppresses them — so [`merge.yaml`](#mergeyaml)'s auto-merge, which
  is keyed on `workflow_run`, never retriggers when its checks go green and the PR only lands on the hourly sweep.
  Authoring as the App restores the trigger. Skip both inputs if you don't auto-merge release PRs.
- **Publishing docs:** add a `zensical.toml` (plus `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`) at the repo root and set **Settings →
  Pages → Source → GitHub Actions**. On each release the `docs` job runs `uv run zensical build` and deploys `./site` to
  Pages. It renders `docs/` only — no language build — so a repo whose docs embed generated reference (e.g. a CLI/man
  dump) must commit that output. Nothing to configure beyond the file and the Pages source.
- **Signing and notarizing macOS binaries:** add a
  [`notarize.macos`](https://goreleaser.com/customization/sign/notarize/) block to `.goreleaser.yaml` and pass the five
  `macos-*` secrets. GoReleaser's embedded quill signs each darwin binary with the org's Developer ID certificate and
  submits it to Apple's notary service from the Linux runner — no macOS runner, no Pro licence — so a downloaded binary
  runs without a Gatekeeper prompt and the Homebrew cask needs no quarantine-stripping hook. One-time org setup and the
  consumer-side config are in [macOS notarization: org setup](#macos-notarization-org-setup).
- **Permissions (caller grants):** `contents: write`, `issues: write`, `pull-requests: write`, `id-token: write`,
  `attestations: write`, `artifact-metadata: write`, `pages: write`. Grant all seven even without a `.goreleaser.yaml`
  or `zensical.toml`: GitHub resolves a reusable workflow's permissions as the union of every job and ignores `if:`, so
  the skipped GoReleaser job's `id-token` / `attestations` / `artifact-metadata` and the docs job's `pages` are still
  required or the run fails at startup.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
permissions:
  contents: write
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
  id-token: write # cosign keyless signing + docs Pages OIDC deploy
  attestations: write # github build-provenance attestation
  artifact-metadata: write # artifact storage record for the attestation
  pages: write # publish docs to GitHub Pages (when a zensical.toml exists)
jobs:
  release:
    uses: the-marmack/github-workflows/.github/workflows/release.yaml@v2
    with:
      vanity-tags: true # for Actions/reusable repos pinned @v1
    secrets:
      homebrew-tap-token: ${{ secrets.HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN }} # optional
```

Full example: [`examples/release.yaml`](examples/release.yaml).

### `merge.yaml`

_Any repo._ Signature-preserving fast-forward merge — the manual `/merge` and the set-and-forget auto-merge in one
workflow. `/merge` merges an approved, green PR now; arming auto-merge (a `/auto-merge` comment or the `auto-merge`
label) fast-forwards it automatically the moment it is approved and every required check is green. Both run the same
`ff-merge` action with a short-lived App token (commit objects untouched, so signatures survive), and `ff-merge`
re-verifies write access, approval, all checks, and a genuine fast-forward before moving the ref. There is no GitHub
event for "all of a repo's own Actions checks finished" (GitHub does not fire `check_suite` for `GITHUB_TOKEN` runs), so
auto-merge observes completion via `workflow_run(completed)` listing every required workflow. Requires branch protection
that requires PR review. See [org setup](#fast-forward-merge-org-setup).

- **Inputs:** `app-client-id` (required; `vars.FF_MERGE_CLIENT_ID`), `merge-command` (default `/merge`), `arm-command`
  (default `/auto-merge`), `label` (default `auto-merge`), `require-approval` (default `true`), `maintainer-only`
  (default `true`), `squash-authors` (default `the-marmack-renovate[bot]`; author logins whose PRs are squash-merged via
  the API instead of fast-forwarded — see below).
- **Renovate PRs (squash instead of fast-forward):** Renovate's shared preset arms the update types it does not
  automerge itself (majors, 0.x) with the `auto-merge` label, and `ff-merge` squash-merges PRs from the `squash-authors`
  logins rather than fast-forwarding: Renovate never rebases its branches onto the base (`rebaseWhen: conflicted`), so
  they are never fast-forwardable, while an API squash needs only a conflict-free branch and lands a GitHub-signed
  (`web-flow`) commit that satisfies the required-signatures ruleset. Approval plus green checks is still required, so a
  breaking-change PR merges the moment a human approves it — no bot rebase queue, no manual merge.
- **Secrets:** `app-private-key` — required (`secrets.FF_MERGE_PRIVATE_KEY`).
- **Permissions (caller grants):** none — the App token does the privileged work, so the caller sets `permissions: {}`.
- **Triggers (the caller owns them):** `issue_comment` (`created`) drives `/merge` and arms `/auto-merge`;
  `workflow_run` (`completed`, listing your CI workflow name(s) plus `Merge Review Ack`) attempts the auto-merge once
  approved and green; the `schedule` sweeps armed PRs as a backstop. A `/merge`-only repo can trigger just
  `issue_comment`. Every trigger is one that does **not** attach a check run to the PR (no `pull_request`,
  `pull_request_review`, or `pull_request_target`), so the workflow leaves no skipped-job clutter on the PR's checks
  list, and none run PR code.
- **No skipped-check clutter:** because the approval signal (the PR-attached `pull_request_review` event) is captured by
  the companion [`merge-review-ack.yaml`](#merge-review-ackyaml) and re-enters via `workflow_run`, the only check this
  system adds to a PR is that companion's single `ack` job. The arm path also responds only to the `/auto-merge`
  comment; adding the `auto-merge` label by hand still arms (the label is the durable state), and the merge then happens
  on the next `workflow_run` or the scheduled sweep.
- **Fork PRs:** `issue_comment` and `workflow_run` carry base-context secrets on a fork, so fork and same-repo PRs
  auto-merge identically — arm with `/auto-merge` and an approval (routed through `merge-review-ack.yaml`) completes the
  merge. Install that companion and keep `Merge Review Ack` in the `workflow_run` list; the scheduled `sweep` backstops
  any missed trigger.

```yaml
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  workflow_run:
    # your CI workflow name(s) — all that must be green — plus the review-ack companion
    workflows: ["CI", "Merge Review Ack"]
    types: [completed]
  schedule:
    - cron: "17 * * * *" # backstop sweep of armed PRs; tune or remove
permissions: {}
jobs:
  merge:
    uses: the-marmack/github-workflows/.github/workflows/merge.yaml@v2
    with:
      app-client-id: ${{ vars.FF_MERGE_CLIENT_ID }}
    secrets:
      app-private-key: ${{ secrets.FF_MERGE_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

Full example: [`examples/merge.yaml`](examples/merge.yaml). Pair it with
[`merge-review-ack.yaml`](#merge-review-ackyaml).

### `merge-review-ack.yaml`

_Any repo._ Required companion to [`merge.yaml`](#mergeyaml): it carries the **approval** signal for auto-merge.
`merge.yaml` deliberately subscribes to no PR-attached events (to avoid skipped-check clutter), but an approval only
exists as the PR-attached `pull_request_review` event — which also carries no secrets on a fork. This workflow's single
job completes on an approving review purely so its `workflow_run(completed)` re-enters `merge.yaml`'s
`merge-on-review-completed` job in base context, where the App token is minted and the fast-forward done. That makes
fork and same-repo PRs merge identically on approval, and it is the **only** check this merge system adds to a PR. It
does no privileged work and needs no secrets; `ff-merge` re-verifies approval, checks, label, and fast-forwardness
before moving the ref. Add `Merge Review Ack` to your `merge.yaml` caller's `workflow_run` list.

- **Inputs:** none.
- **Secrets:** none.
- **Permissions (caller grants):** none.

```yaml
on:
  pull_request_review:
    types: [submitted]
permissions: {}
jobs:
  ack:
    uses: the-marmack/github-workflows/.github/workflows/merge-review-ack.yaml@v2
```

Full example: [`examples/merge-review-ack.yaml`](examples/merge-review-ack.yaml).

### `merge-notice.yaml`

_Any repo._ Posts a one-time comment on newly opened PRs explaining the repo merges via `/merge`. Uses
`pull_request_target` so the notice reaches fork PRs too.

- **Inputs:** `pr-number` — required.
- **Secrets:** none.
- **Permissions (caller grants):** `pull-requests: write`.

```yaml
on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened]
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  notice:
    uses: the-marmack/github-workflows/.github/workflows/merge-notice.yaml@v2
    with:
      pr-number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
```

Full example: [`examples/merge-notice.yaml`](examples/merge-notice.yaml).

### `add-to-project.yaml`

_Any repo._ Adds the triggering issue (or PR) to a shared organisation **Projects v2** board — the org "Roadmap" — so
new issues from every repo collect in one place. `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot write an org-level project, so this mints a
short-lived token from a dedicated **Project Sync** GitHub App (the same `create-github-app-token` pattern as
[`merge.yaml`](#mergeyaml)), downscoped to `organization-projects: write` plus `issues` / `pull-requests: read`, and
hands it to [`actions/add-to-project`](https://github.com/actions/add-to-project). The App must be installed on the repo
whose issue fires the caller — install it on **all repositories**. In this org the caller is fanned out to every repo by
`org-config.sh workflows-sync` in [`github-settings`](https://github.com/the-marmack/github-settings).

- **Inputs:** `project-url` (required; `https://github.com/orgs/<org>/projects/<n>`), `app-client-id` (required;
  `vars.ADD_TO_PROJECT_CLIENT_ID`), `labeled` (optional; comma-separated labels to filter on), `label-operator`
  (optional; `AND` / `OR` / `NOT`, default `OR`).
- **Secrets:** `app-private-key` — required (`secrets.ADD_TO_PROJECT_PRIVATE_KEY`).
- **Permissions (caller grants):** none — the App token does the privileged work, so the caller job sets
  `permissions: {}`.
- **Triggers (the caller owns it):** `issues` (`opened`) is the usual choice; any event carrying an issue or PR works.
- **Org setup (one-time):** create a **Project Sync** App with organization **projects** read/write and repository
  **issues** + **pull requests** read, install it on all repositories, and expose it as the `ADD_TO_PROJECT_CLIENT_ID`
  variable + `ADD_TO_PROJECT_PRIVATE_KEY` secret.

```yaml
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions: {}
jobs:
  add:
    uses: the-marmack/github-workflows/.github/workflows/add-to-project.yaml@v4
    with:
      project-url: https://github.com/orgs/the-marmack/projects/1
      app-client-id: ${{ vars.ADD_TO_PROJECT_CLIENT_ID }}
    secrets:
      app-private-key: ${{ secrets.ADD_TO_PROJECT_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

Full example: [`examples/add-to-project.yaml`](examples/add-to-project.yaml).

### `renovate.yaml`

_Any repo._ Runs the org's self-hosted [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) bot against **this repository only** —
same "Renovate" App, same bot-side config and org preset from
[`the-marmack/renovate-config`](https://github.com/the-marmack/renovate-config) — so each repo has its own schedule and
its runs are parallel and independent of the org-wide loop, which grows longer with every repository it walks. The job
checks out the config repository and hands `renovate-global.json5` to Renovate unchanged, then pins the run to the
calling repository through the environment (autodiscover off, `repositories` = this repo). Beyond the cron, the caller
listens for `issues: [edited]` and `pull_request: [edited]`: a human ticking a checkbox in the Dependency Dashboard
issue or a Renovate PR body (rebase/retry, create rate-limited PRs, …) is a body edit, and the job runs Renovate
immediately instead of at the next tick. Renovate's own body rewrites (a Bot sender) are filtered out so a run never
triggers the next one, and edits to any other issue or PR skip the job. The merge model is the org bot's: API-created
Verified commits, the App's pull-request ruleset bypass for squash-merging green in-policy PRs, one automerge per base
branch per run. The App token is scoped to the calling repository, so the config repository must be public (it is).

- **Inputs:** `app-client-id` (required; `vars.RENOVATE_CLIENT_ID`), `config-repository` (default
  `the-marmack/renovate-config`), `config-ref` (default `main`), `config-file` (default `renovate-global.json5`),
  `dry-run` (default empty = live; `extract`, `lookup` or `full`), `log-level` (default `info`).
- **Secrets:** `app-private-key` — required (`secrets.RENOVATE_PRIVATE_KEY`).
- **Permissions (caller grants):** none — the App token does the privileged work, so the caller sets `permissions: {}`.
- **Triggers (the caller owns it):** `schedule` (hourly — Renovate automerges one PR per base branch per run, so the
  cron is also the merge throughput), `workflow_dispatch` (forwarding `dry-run` / `log-level`), `issues` (`edited`) and
  `pull_request` (`edited`). The `pull_request` trigger leaves a skipped job on every PR body edit that is not a
  Renovate checkbox; that is the price of reacting to the checkbox at all.
- **Org setup:** the "Renovate" App installed on the repo, exposed as the `RENOVATE_CLIENT_ID` variable +
  `RENOVATE_PRIVATE_KEY` secret (org-level, all repositories). Keep the org-wide bot off a repo that runs this caller —
  exclude it in the org bot's `autodiscoverFilter`, or retire that loop once every repo carries the caller — since two
  bots on one repo race on branches and automerge.

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "24 * * * *"
  workflow_dispatch:
  issues:
    types: [edited]
  pull_request:
    types: [edited]
permissions: {}
jobs:
  renovate:
    uses: the-marmack/github-workflows/.github/workflows/renovate.yaml@v7
    with:
      app-client-id: ${{ vars.RENOVATE_CLIENT_ID }}
    secrets:
      app-private-key: ${{ secrets.RENOVATE_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

Full example: [`examples/renovate.yaml`](examples/renovate.yaml).

## Consumer contracts

The reusable workflows stay free of per-repo configuration by assuming a small contract. The **mise config is the
language boundary** — every repo provides the same canonical tasks and the workflows just run `mise run <task>`, with
every toolchain installed from the same mise pins:

- **mise tasks** — defined in a root `mise.toml`, or by the shared toolchain
  ([`the-marmack/toolchain`](https://github.com/the-marmack/toolchain)) mounted as a submodule at `.mise/`: `lint` (all
  check-mode static analysis: `prettier --check`, markdownlint, and for Go `go vet` / `govulncheck`), `build`, `test`
  (emitting `coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml`, optionally `coverage/junit.xml`), and `e2e`. Define only the tasks that
  do real work — CI discovers the task list and skips the rest; coverage is optional. A repo with no mise config fails
  CI.
- **Toolchains** — no `setup-go` / `setup-node` / `setup-uv`: the language runtimes (Go, Node, Python, uv) and every dev
  CLI (goreleaser, cosign, syft, the linters, …) are installed from the mise pins, sha256-verified against `mise.lock`
  and restored from the mise cache, so CI, release and local runs use identical versions. The tasks install their own
  project dependencies (the workflow never runs `npm ci` or `go mod download` itself). A tools-only `go.work` with a
  `tools/go.mod` (for `go tool addlicense`) is universal dev tooling, so it is **not** a Go-product signal for CodeQL —
  only a root `go.mod` is.
- **CodeQL** — scans `actions` always, `go` (autobuild, with the Go toolchain from the mise pins) when a root `go.mod`
  exists, and `javascript-typescript` when `package.json` exists. A repo with a bundled `dist/` should pass
  `config-file: ./.github/codeql/codeql-config.yaml` (copy [`examples/codeql-config.yaml`](examples/codeql-config.yaml))
  to exclude it.
- **Release** — `release-please-config.json` + `.release-please-manifest.json`; a `.goreleaser.yaml`
  (`release-type: go`, `draft: true`) selects the GoReleaser path, otherwise the release is just the release-please cut.
  A `zensical.toml` selects the docs path (rebuild the Zensical site and publish to Pages; needs Pages set to GitHub
  Actions and `pages: write`). Set `vanity-tags: true` to move the floating `v1` / `v1.1` tags (after GoReleaser when
  present); a committed `dist/` is verified in CI, not here. To sign and notarize macOS binaries, add a `notarize.macos`
  block to `.goreleaser.yaml` and pass the `macos-*` secrets (see
  [macOS notarization: org setup](#macos-notarization-org-setup)).

A caller may mix a reusable-workflow job with normal jobs — e.g. a Go CLI keeps its product-specific `integration` /
`e2e` jobs in the same `ci.yaml` that calls the reusable `ci.yaml`.

## Pinning

The examples pin every `uses:` to an all-zeros placeholder SHA with the release it stands for in a trailing comment
(`@0000…0000 # v7.0.0`); replace the zeros with that release's full commit SHA (`git rev-parse v7.0.0`, or the commit
listed on the release page) before the caller will run. Policy is a full SHA for every action, first-party included
(this library's own zizmor config enforces it), and Renovate keeps the SHA and the version comment in step from there.
The `# x-release-please-version` marker on each `uses:` line is for this repository's release automation, which rewrites
the version comment in every release PR so the examples always name the release they document; drop it or keep it, the
copied caller works either way. Avoid `@main` except for short-lived testing.

## Fast-forward merge: org setup

`merge.yaml` (the `/merge` + auto-merge flows) drives the `the-marmack/ff-merge` action; `merge-notice.yaml` posts the
companion convention reminder. The one-time org setup (the "FF Merge" GitHub App, its ruleset bypass, and the
`FF_MERGE_CLIENT_ID` variable + `FF_MERGE_PRIVATE_KEY` secret) is documented in
[`the-marmack/ff-merge`](https://github.com/the-marmack/ff-merge).

> **Note on App input names.** This library's contract is input `app-client-id` + secret `app-private-key`, backed by
> `vars.FF_MERGE_CLIENT_ID` / `secrets.FF_MERGE_PRIVATE_KEY`. Existing callers across the org currently use inconsistent
> names (`client-id`/`app-key`, or `app-id`/`app-key` with `FF_APP_ID`/`FF_APP_KEY`); align them to the names above when
> migrating to these reusable workflows. The macOS notarization secrets follow the same convention: `macos-sign-p12` ←
> `secrets.MACOS_SIGN_P12`, `macos-sign-password` ← `MACOS_SIGN_PASSWORD`, `macos-notary-issuer-id` ←
> `MACOS_NOTARY_ISSUER_ID`, `macos-notary-key-id` ← `MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_ID`, `macos-notary-key` ← `MACOS_NOTARY_KEY`.

## macOS notarization: org setup

`release.yaml` signs and notarizes the darwin binaries of any consumer whose `.goreleaser.yaml` has a
[`notarize.macos`](https://goreleaser.com/customization/sign/notarize/) block: GoReleaser's embedded
[quill](https://github.com/anchore/quill) signs each Mach-O with a Developer ID Application certificate (hardened
runtime flag set, Apple timestamp attached) and submits it to Apple's notary service, all on the `ubuntu-latest` runner
— no macOS runner and no GoReleaser Pro. A notarized binary runs from a browser download without a Gatekeeper prompt
(the ticket is fetched online on first run; a bare Mach-O cannot be stapled), so the Homebrew cask needs no
`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine` hook. The setup below is done **once for the organisation**: one shared Developer ID
Application certificate and one App Store Connect team API key, stored as five org secrets visible only to the
repositories that notarize. Every Developer ID Application certificate Apple issues to the team carries the identical
subject (`Developer ID Application: <Team> (<TEAMID>)` — the CSR's CN and email are not carried into it), so per-binary
certificates would only buy independent revocation at the cost of a `.p12` secret per repo.

**Prerequisites.** Apple Developer Program membership current and the latest agreements accepted, signed in as the
**Account Holder** — the only role that can create Developer ID certificates.
`gh auth refresh -h github.com -s admin:org` once so `gh secret set --org` works. `quill` (`brew install quill` or
`mise use -g aqua:anchore/quill`) only for the optional `.p12` check.

**Step 1 — the shared signing certificate (once).** Make a key and CSR, have Apple issue the certificate against it, and
bundle leaf + key into a `.p12`. The CN and email only label the CSR in the portal; Apple composes the issued subject
itself.

```sh
name=the-marmack-oss
dir=$(mktemp -d)
# key + CSR (RSA-2048)
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \
  -keyout "$dir/$name.key" -out "$dir/$name.certSigningRequest" \
  -subj "/emailAddress=<you@example.com>/CN=the-marmack OSS Release Signing/C=<CC>"
```

At <https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/add>: **Software → Developer ID → Developer ID
Application**, profile type **G2 Sub-CA**, upload `$dir/$name.certSigningRequest`, then **Download**
(`developerID_application.cer`).

```sh
# p12 = leaf + key. quill attaches Apple's Developer ID G2 chain itself, so no
# `quill p12 attach-chain`; OpenSSL 3's default PBES2/AES-256 encryption decodes
# fine, so do NOT pass -legacy. `-in` needs PEM, hence the DER conversion first.
openssl x509 -inform der -in developerID_application.cer -out "$dir/$name.crt"
# sanity check: the subject must read "Developer ID Application: ..." — a
# Developer ID *Installer* certificate carries a critical extension
# (1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.14) quill rejects with "x509: unhandled critical extension"
openssl x509 -in "$dir/$name.crt" -noout -subject
password=$(openssl rand -base64 24)
openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey "$dir/$name.key" -in "$dir/$name.crt" -name "$name" \
  -out "$dir/$name.p12" -passout "pass:$password"
quill p12 describe "$dir/$name.p12"    # optional: shows the leaf + the resolved chain
# record these, and back the .p12 + password up in the password manager: Apple
# cannot re-issue a private key, so a lost key means revoke + reissue.
openssl x509 -in "$dir/$name.crt" -noout -serial -fingerprint -sha256 -enddate
```

**Step 2 — the team API key (once).** App Store Connect → **Users and Access → Integrations → App Store Connect API →
Team Keys → Generate**: name `GitHub Actions Notarization`, access **Developer**. Download `AuthKey_<KEYID>.p8` (offered
once) and copy the **Issuer ID** (top of the page) and the **Key ID**.

**Step 3 — org secrets, visible to the notarizing repos only.** The base64 values are single-line so GitHub masks them
in logs. Clean up the local key material once the secrets are set and the backup is in the password manager.

```sh
org=the-marmack; repos=<repo1>,<repo2>
gh secret set MACOS_SIGN_P12         --org $org --visibility selected --repos $repos \
  --body "$(base64 -i "$dir/$name.p12" | tr -d '\n')"
gh secret set MACOS_SIGN_PASSWORD    --org $org --visibility selected --repos $repos --body "$password"
gh secret set MACOS_NOTARY_ISSUER_ID --org $org --visibility selected --repos $repos --body "<issuer id>"
gh secret set MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_ID    --org $org --visibility selected --repos $repos --body "<key id>"
gh secret set MACOS_NOTARY_KEY       --org $org --visibility selected --repos $repos \
  --body "$(base64 -i ~/Downloads/AuthKey_<KEYID>.p8 | tr -d '\n')"

rm -rf "$dir" ~/Downloads/AuthKey_<KEYID>.p8 ~/Downloads/developerID_application.cer
```

**Consumer side.** Put darwin in its own build id and limit `binary_signs.ids` to the non-darwin ids: GoReleaser runs
`binary_signs` (cosign) _before_ notarization, which rewrites the Mach-O in place, so a cosign bundle over the darwin
binary would never verify against what ships — and the OSS `binary_signs` has no per-artifact `if`, so the build id is
the only handle. The darwin binaries are covered by the Apple signature and notarization plus the SLSA attestation over
`checksums.txt`. Then add the block and pass the five secrets from the caller (commented lines in
[`examples/release.yaml`](examples/release.yaml)):

```yaml
notarize:
  macos:
    # every real release notarizes (and fails if the secrets are missing); a
    # snapshot only does when MACOS_SIGN_P12 is exported, so `goreleaser
    # release --snapshot` stays offline and a local end-to-end test is one env
    # export away
    - enabled: '{{ or (not .IsSnapshot) (isEnvSet "MACOS_SIGN_P12") }}'
      ids: [<darwin build id>]
      sign:
        certificate: "{{ .Env.MACOS_SIGN_P12 }}"
        password: "{{ .Env.MACOS_SIGN_PASSWORD }}"
      notarize:
        issuer_id: "{{ .Env.MACOS_NOTARY_ISSUER_ID }}"
        key_id: "{{ .Env.MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_ID }}"
        key: "{{ .Env.MACOS_NOTARY_KEY }}"
        wait: true
        timeout: 15m
```

Verify a shipped binary on a Mac with `codesign -dv --verbose=4 <binary>` (Authority =
`Developer ID Application: … (TEAMID)`, flags include `runtime`) and `spctl -a -vv -t install <binary>`
(`source=Notarized Developer ID`).

**Onboarding another repo.** Add it to each secret's repository list — org **Settings → Secrets and variables →
Actions**, or `gh api -X PUT orgs/$org/actions/secrets/<NAME>/repositories/$(gh api repos/$org/<repo> --jq .id)` for
each of the five — then make the consumer-side changes. No new Apple material is needed.

**Rotation and revocation.** The certificate is valid for five years. Revoking it in the developer portal invalidates
future signing for every repo at once (binaries already notarized keep running), so rotate by issuing a new certificate
with step 1 and re-running the `MACOS_SIGN_P12` / `MACOS_SIGN_PASSWORD` `gh secret set`. The API key is revoked in App
Store Connect → Team Keys; generate a new one and re-run the three `MACOS_NOTARY_*` `gh secret set`s.

## Testing changes

This repo dogfoods its own reusable workflows by local path: `self-ci.yaml` calls `ci.yaml` (which installs the tools
pinned by the `.mise/` toolchain submodule and runs the one task this repo defines, `lint`) and `self-release.yaml`
calls `release.yaml` (no `.goreleaser.yaml`, so just the release-please cut plus the `vanity-tags` job).
`self-security.yaml` stays a bespoke `actions`-only scan: the library has no compilable Go and no JS/TS product source,
so an `actions` CodeQL pass is the whole surface. The `/merge` + auto-merge flows (`self-merge.yaml`), its fork-PR
review-ack companion (`self-merge-review-ack.yaml`), the merge notice (`self-merge-notice.yaml`) and the per-repo
Renovate run (`self-renovate.yaml`) dogfood the rest. That Renovate run is also this repo's own dependency automation
(action SHA pins and the `.mise` submodule tag), on the org bot's config from
[`the-marmack/renovate-config`](https://github.com/the-marmack/renovate-config). Validate a change to a reusable
workflow by temporarily pointing a real consumer's caller at a feature branch or SHA (`@your-branch`) and opening a PR
there.

## Releasing this repo

`self-release.yaml` calls the reusable `release.yaml` (`release-type: simple`, `vanity-tags: true`) on pushes to `main`;
merging the release PR cuts `vX.Y.Z` and moves the floating major and minor tags (`v2`, `v2.1`). Consumers pin to those
tags.
