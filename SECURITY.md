# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately via
[GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/the-marmack/github-workflows/security/advisories/new). Do not
open public issues for security reports.

## Threat model (summary)

This repository is the organisation's central library of **reusable workflows** (`on: workflow_call`). Each workflow is
invoked by a thin caller in a consumer repository that owns the trigger and grants the permissions; the reusable
workflow then runs inside the caller's `GITHUB_TOKEN` and secrets context. The library author cannot see or constrain
how a consumer wires the caller's trigger, so the workflows are written to be safe regardless of the calling context.
They defend against:

- **Untrusted code execution in a privileged context** — the release pipelines check out a release-please-computed tag
  and run build code (`goreleaser`, `npm run all`). GitHub Actions has no way for a reusable workflow to declare which
  trigger events may call it, so the privileged checkout-and-build jobs are gated on a positive allowlist of trusted
  triggers (`push`, `workflow_dispatch`, `schedule`). Anything else — the fork-controllable `pull_request_target`,
  `issue_comment`, and `workflow_run`, or any new event type GitHub adds later — is skipped, so the "pwn request" path
  fails closed rather than relying on the consumer wiring their caller correctly.
- **Supply-chain tampering via third-party actions** — every external action is pinned to a full commit SHA with a
  human-readable version comment, so a moved or re-pointed tag cannot change what runs.
- **Excess privilege** — workflows declare `permissions: {}` at the top level and grant the minimum scopes per job, so a
  compromised step has only the access that job needs.
- **Secret leakage across the call boundary** — secrets are passed explicitly through `workflow_call.secrets` (no
  `secrets: inherit`), and `run:` steps pass interpolated values through quoted environment variables rather than
  inlining them into the script, avoiding expression-injection.
- **Apple signing material** — the Developer ID certificate and App Store Connect API key that sign and notarize macOS
  binaries in `release.yaml` are passed only through `workflow_call.secrets` into GoReleaser's environment and consumed
  in-process by its embedded quill; they are never written to the workspace or logged (the base64 values are
  single-line, so GitHub's secret masking covers them). The single shared certificate is an org secret whose visibility
  list is the allowlist of repositories that may sign as the organisation, and it is revocable and rotatable in one
  place.

Out of scope: a compromise of the GitHub Actions runner executing a workflow; a compromise of a consumer repository's
own secrets, PATs, or branch protections; and the trust placed in first-party `the-marmack` actions referenced
by these workflows (e.g. `ff-merge`), whose own repositories are the trust anchor.

## Code scanning triage

CodeQL findings are triaged in [`security/code-scanning/index.md`](security/code-scanning/index.md), with a report per
finding recording why it was dismissed or how it was remediated.
